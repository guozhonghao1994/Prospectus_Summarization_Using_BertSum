Our Mission  Our mission
is to make it easy to do business anywhere.  Our founders started our company to champion small businesses, in the belief that the
Internet would level the playing field by enabling small enterprises to leverage innovation and technology to grow and compete more effectively in the domestic and global economies. Our decisions are guided by how they serve our mission over the
long-term, not by the pursuit of short-term gains.  Our Business 
We are the largest online and mobile commerce company in the world in terms of gross merchandise volume in 2013, according to the IDC GMV
Report. We operate our ecosystem as a platform for third parties, and we do not engage in direct sales, compete with our merchants or hold inventory.
We operate Taobao Marketplace, Chinas largest online shopping destination, Tmall, Chinas largest third-party platform for brands
and retailers, in each case in terms of gross merchandise volume, and Juhuasuan, Chinas most popular group buying marketplace by its monthly active users, in each case in 2013 according to iResearch. These three marketplaces, which comprise
our China retail marketplaces, generated a combined GMV of RMB1,833 billion (US$296 billion) from 279 million active buyers and 8.5 million active sellers in the twelve months ended June 30, 2014. A significant portion of our customers have begun
transacting on our mobile platform, and we are focused on capturing this opportunity. In the three months ended June 30, 2014, mobile GMV accounted for 32.8% of our GMV, up from 27.4% in the preceding three months and from 12.0% in the same period
in the previous year. The number of mobile MAUs increased from 136 million for the month ended December 31, 2013, to 163 million for the month ended March 31, 2014 and to 188 million for the month ended June 30, 2014.
In addition to our three China retail marketplaces, which accounted for 81.6% of our revenues in fiscal year 2014, we operate Alibaba.com,
Chinas largest global online wholesale marketplace in 2013 by revenue, according to iResearch, 1688.com, our China wholesale marketplace, and AliExpress, our global consumer marketplace, as well as provide cloud computing services.
As a platform, we provide the fundamental technology infrastructure and marketing reach to help businesses leverage the power of the Internet
to establish an online presence and conduct commerce with consumers and businesses. We have been a leader in developing online marketplace standards in China. Given the scale we have been able to achieve, an ecosystem has developed around our
platform that consists of buyers, sellers, third-party service providers, strategic alliance partners, and investee companies. Our platform and the role we play in connecting buyers and sellers and making it possible for them to do business anytime
and anywhere is at the nexus of this ecosystem. Much of our effort, our time and our energy is spent on initiatives that are for the greater good of the ecosystem and the various participants in it. We feel a strong responsibility for the continued
development of the ecosystem and we take ownership for this development. Accordingly, we refer to this as our ecosystem.  Our
ecosystem has strong self-reinforcing network effects that benefit our marketplace participants, who are invested in our ecosystems growth and success. Through this ecosystem, we have transformed how commerce is conducted in China and built a
reputation as a trusted partner for the participants in our ecosystem.  We have made significant investments in proprietary technologies
and infrastructure in order to support our growing ecosystem. Our technology and infrastructure allow us to harness the substantial volume of data generated from our marketplaces and to further develop and optimize the products and services offered
on our platform.

Through contractual arrangements with Alipay, we offer payment and escrow services for
buyers and sellers, providing security, trust and convenience to our users. Since 2011, we have not held any interest in or control over Alipay or its parent company. Following the divestment of our interest in and control over Alipay, effective in
the first calendar quarter of 2011, we have maintained long-term commercial arrangements with Alipay, which we believe align both companies interests in the success of our ecosystem. We also continue to derive economic benefits from our
contractual arrangements with Alipay. For further details regarding our relationship with Alipay and its parent company, including the recent restructuring of our contractual arrangements with them in August 2014, see Related Party
Transactions  Agreements and Transactions Related to Small and Micro Financial Services Company and its Subsidiaries  Ownership of Small and Micro Financial Services Company. 
We take a platform approach to shipping and delivery by working with third-party logistics service providers through a central logistics
information system operated by Zhejiang Cainiao Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd., or China Smart Logistics, our 48%-owned affiliate. Through our acquisition of UCWeb, we are able to leverage its expertise as a developer and operator of mobile web
browsers to enhance our mobile offerings beyond e-commerce, such as general mobile search, which gives us access to UCWebs large base of mobile users and offers our existing user base additional mobile solutions.  
Our revenue is primarily generated from merchants through online marketing services (via Alimama, our proprietary online marketing platform),
commissions on transactions and fees for online services. We also generate revenues through fees from memberships, value-added services and cloud computing services. GMV generated on our China retail marketplaces increased by 55.8% from RMB1,077
billion in fiscal year 2013 to RMB1,678 billion (US$270 billion) in fiscal year 2014. Our total revenue increased by 52.1% from RMB34,517 million in fiscal year 2013 to RMB52,504 million (US$8,463 million) in fiscal year 2014. Our total revenue
increased by 46.3% from RMB10,778 million in the three months ended June 30, 2013 to RMB15,771 million (US$2,542 million) in the same period in 2014. We do not allocate revenue among each of our China retail marketplaces. Our net income increased by
170.6% from RMB8,649 million in fiscal year 2013 to RMB23,403 million (US$3,772 million) in fiscal year 2014. Our net income increased by 179.6% from RMB4,448 million in the three months ended June 30, 2013 to RMB12,438 million (US$2,005 million) in
the same period in 2014. For the three months ended June 30, 2014, our net income included a net gain of RMB6,251 million (US$1,008 million) from step-up acquisitions arising from revaluations of previously held equity interest. Our fiscal year ends
on March 31.  Our Key Metrics 
We have experienced significant growth across various key metrics for our China retail marketplaces:

The Network Effect on and across Our Marketplaces 
The interactions between buyers and sellers create network effects in that more merchants attract more consumers, and more consumers attract
more merchants. In addition, our marketplaces are interconnected in that many buyers and sellers on one marketplace also participate in the activities on our other marketplaces, thereby creating a second-order network effect that further strengthens
our ecosystem.  The chart below depicts this network effect dynamic in our ecosystem.
  

  








 Buyers  
   Chinese consumers buy on Taobao Marketplace, Tmall and Juhuasuan
     While browsing or
searching on Taobao Marketplace, consumers see product listings from both Taobao Marketplace and Tmall

Our Market Opportunity 
Our market opportunity is primarily driven by the following factors:   


 

 
Our business benefits from the rising spending power of Chinese consumers. Chinas real consumption in 2013 was 35.8% of total GDP, which is a rate that is significantly lower than that of other countries, such as
the United States, which had a consumption penetration rate of 67.1% in 2013, according to Euromonitor International. We believe that growth in consumption will drive higher levels of online and mobile commerce.
 


 

 
Chinas online shopping population is relatively underpenetrated. According to CNNIC, China had the worlds largest Internet population with 618 million users as of December 31, 2013. According to CNNIC,
China had 302 million online shoppers in 2013. We believe the number of online shoppers will increase, driven by continued growth in the number of Internet users as well as by the higher percentage of Internet users making purchases online.
  


 

 
We believe that consumers are expanding the categories of products and services they are purchasing online, which will further increase online and mobile commerce activity.
 


 

 
We believe that the increased usage of mobile devices will make access to the Internet even more convenient, drive higher online shopper engagement and enable new applications. China has the worlds largest mobile
Internet user base with 500 million users as of December 31, 2013, according to CNNIC, and mobile usage is expected to increase, driven by the growing adoption of mobile devices.
 


 

 
Chinas offline retail market faces significant challenges due to few nationwide brick and mortar retailers, an underdeveloped physical retail infrastructure, limited product selection and inconsistent product
quality. These challenges in Chinas retail infrastructure, which we believe are particularly acute outside of tier 1 and 2 cities, are causing consumers to leapfrog the offline retail market in favor of online and mobile commerce.
  


 

 
China has an increasingly extensive and rapidly improving logistics infrastructure consisting of nationwide, regional and local delivery services. We believe that the rapid development of Chinas distributed
logistics infrastructure and nationwide express delivery networks has been driven in part by the growth of e-commerce and will continue to support the unique demands of consumers and merchants conducting e-commerce transactions on marketplaces.  Overall, online shopping, which represented 8.0%
of total China consumption in 2013, is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 36.1% from 2013 to 2016, according to iResearch, as more consumers shop online and e-commerce spending per consumer increases.
Our Strengths  We believe
that the following strengths contribute to our success and are differentiating factors that set us apart from our peers.   


 

 
Management Team with Owner Mentality and Proven Track Record. Our management teams clear sense of mission, long-term focus and commitment to the values that define the Alibaba culture have
been central to our successful track record. Our management team has created and grown leading businesses organically, including Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, Alibaba.com, Alibaba Cloud Computing and Alipay.
 


 

 
Trusted Brands. Alibaba, Taobao, Tmall and Alipay are well recognized and trusted brands in China. Due to the strength of these brands, a majority of our customers navigate directly to our China
retail marketplaces to find the products and services they are seeking instead of via third-party search engines.


 
Thriving Ecosystem with Powerful Network Effects. We are the steward of a thriving ecosystem, which provides us with the following key advantages: 
 


 

 
participants in our ecosystem are invested in its success and growth;   


 

 
interactions among participants create value for one another as our ecosystem expands and generates strong network effects; and   


 

 
the scope of our ecosystem and the network effects it creates, including the significant buyer traffic generated by our Taobao Marketplace, provide low-cost organic traffic for our other marketplaces and services and
significantly reduce our reliance on a sales force for our marketing services.   


 

 
Mobile Leadership. We are the leader in mobile commerce in China in terms of mobile retail GMV, with mobile GMV transacted on our China retail marketplaces accounting for 86.1% of total
mobile retail GMV in China in the three months ended June 30, 2014, according to iResearch. Our Mobile Taobao App has been the most popular mobile commerce app in China by mobile MAUs every month since August 2012, according to iResearch. We had 188
million mobile MAUs on our China retail marketplaces in June 2014.   


 

 
Scalable Logistics Platform. We offer sellers on our marketplaces the benefits of a distributed and scalable logistics platform and information system to provide high quality delivery services to sellers
and buyers on a large scale. Our platform approach helps to address the requirements of facilitating the delivery of packages across a wide range of product categories from millions of sellers to millions of buyers in dispersed locations across
China. The scalability of this network was demonstrated by its success in the handling of 156 million packages generated on our Singles Day promotion in 2013 compared to a daily average of 16.6 million packages generated from transactions on our
China retail marketplaces in the twelve months ended June 30, 2014.   


 

 
Reliable, Scalable and Cost-effective Proprietary Technology. We have developed proprietary technology that is reliable, scalable and cost-effective. Our technology is designed to handle the
large volume of transactions on our marketplaces. For example, we successfully processed 254 million orders within 24 hours during our Singles Day promotion on November 11, 2013.
 


 

 
Data Insights. Data from consumer behavior and transactions completed on our marketplaces and interactions among participants in our ecosystem provide us with valuable insights to help us and
our sellers improve the buyer experience, operate more efficiently and create innovative products and services.   


 

 
Third-party Platform Business Model. Our exclusively third-party platform business model allows us to scale rapidly without the risks and capital requirements of sourcing, merchandising and
holding inventory borne by direct sales companies. This business model drives our profitability and strong cash flow, which give us the flexibility to further invest in and improve our platform, expand our ecosystem and aggressively invest in
people, technology, innovative products and strategically important assets.  Our Strategies 
The key elements of our strategy to grow our business include:   


 

 
Increase Active Buyers and Wallet Share. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2014, the average active buyer on our China retail marketplaces placed 52 orders, up from 45 orders in the same period in 2013
and 35 orders in the same period in 2012. We will continue to develop and market the value proposition of our retail marketplaces to attract new buyers as well as to increase the wallet share of existing buyers through more frequent buying and
buying across more product categories. We intend to achieve growth through customer loyalty programs, high quality customer service, marketing and promotional campaigns, and expansion of marketing affiliates, as well as by promoting the usage of our
various mobile commerce apps such as our Mobile Taobao App.

Table of Contents



 

 
Expand Categories and Offerings. We aim to enhance the shopping experience for consumers, increase consumer engagement and create additional opportunities for merchants by developing and promoting
additional categories and offerings. We believe that growth in the number of product and service categories and products and services purchased within each category contributes to higher average spending per customer and increases GMV.
  


 

 
Extend Our Mobile Leadership. We intend to build upon our strength in mobile commerce to develop a broader spectrum of consumer offerings, such as location-based services, O2O services and digital content,
in order to fulfill our vision of becoming central to the everyday lives of our customers. We will also continue to look for ways to increase our mobile user base and engagement through strategic alliances, investments and acquisitions, such as our
acquisition of UCWeb.   


 

 
Enhance the Success of Sellers on a Broad Basis. We aim to increase the success of a broad base of sellers on our marketplaces by increasing their exposure to relevant buyer demand and
providing them with more tools such as data science applications to manage their relationships with customers.   


 

 
Enhance Data and Cloud Computing Technologies. We will continue to implement our data strategy through the application of data intelligence and deep learning technologies to several fields, including
marketplace design, user interface, search, targeted marketing, logistics, location-based services and financial services, among others. In addition, we will continue to invest heavily in our cloud computing platform to support our own businesses
and those of third parties.   


 

 
Develop Cross-border Commerce Opportunities. Our international strategy is focused on leveraging cross-border linkages to our ecosystem that enable foreign brands and merchants to access the
Chinese consumer markets without significant capital investments while providing Chinese manufacturers and merchants with a platform to reach businesses and consumers across the world. For example, we will continue to grow our international business
by connecting overseas branded retailers to Chinese consumers (Tmall Global) and connecting Chinese suppliers to international retail markets (AliExpress) and international wholesale markets (Alibaba.com).
Alibaba Partnership  Since
our founders first gathered in Jack Mas apartment in 1999, they and our management have acted in the spirit of partnership. We view our culture as fundamental to our success and our ability to serve our customers, develop our employees and
deliver long-term value to our shareholders. In July 2010, in order to preserve this spirit of partnership and to ensure the sustainability of our mission, vision and values, we decided to formalize this partnership as Lakeside Partners, named after
the Lakeside Gardens residential community where Jack and our other founders started our company. We refer to the partnership as the Alibaba Partnership.
We believe that our partnership approach has helped us to better manage our business, with the peer nature of the partnership enabling senior
managers to collaborate and override bureaucracy and hierarchy. The Alibaba Partnership currently has 30 members comprised of 24 members of our management, five members of management of Small and Micro Financial Services Company and one member of
management of China Smart Logistics. Two partners who are members of our management are also members of management of Small and Micro Financial Services Company. The partnership operates under principles, policies and procedures that have evolved
with our business and are described below.  Our partnership is a dynamic body that rejuvenates itself through admission of new partners
each year, which we believe enhances our excellence, innovation and sustainability. Unlike dual-class ownership structures that employ a high-vote class of shares to concentrate control in a few founders, our
approach is designed to embody the vision of a large group of management partners. This structure is our solution for preserving the culture shaped by our founders while at the same time accounting for the fact that founders will inevitably retire
from the company.


 
New partners are elected annually after a nomination process based on a number of criteria including not less than five years of tenure with Alibaba Group, one of our affiliates and/or certain companies with which we
have a significant relationship such as Small and Micro Financial Services Company, and require a 75% approval of all of the partners. Partnership votes are made on a one-partner-one-vote basis.
 


 

 
Partners are evangelists for our mission, vision and values, both within our organization and externally to customers, business partners and other participants in our ecosystem.
 


 

 
We require each partner to maintain a meaningful level of equity interests in our company during such individuals tenure as a partner.
 


 

 
The Alibaba Partnership will have the exclusive right to nominate for shareholder approval up to a simple majority of the members of our board of directors. If an Alibaba Partnership director nominee is not elected by
our shareholders or departs our board of directors for any reason, the Alibaba Partnership has the right to appoint a different person to serve as an interim director until our next scheduled annual general meeting of shareholders. We expect that
our initial board of directors upon completion of this offering will consist of nine members, and the Alibaba Partnership will designate four of those directors as Alibaba Partnership nominees. If at any time our board of directors consists of less
than a simple majority of directors nominated or appointed by the Alibaba Partnership for any reason  including because the Alibaba Partnership had previously not exercised its right to nominate or appoint a simple majority of our board of
directors  the Alibaba Partnership will be entitled (in its sole discretion and without the need for any additional shareholder approval) to nominate or appoint such number of additional directors as necessary to ensure that the directors
nominated or appointed by the Alibaba Partnership comprise a simple majority of our board of directors. For example, as the Alibaba Partnership will designate only four out of nine of our initial directors as Alibaba Partnership nominees, the
Alibaba Partnership will have the right, following the completion of this offering, to nominate or appoint two additional directors to our board of directors, which would increase the total number of directors to eleven. We expect to enter into a
voting agreement that will take effect upon completion of this offering, pursuant to which both SoftBank and Yahoo will agree to vote their shares in favor of the Alibaba Partnership director nominees at each annual general shareholders meeting
until SoftBanks shareholding declines below 15% of our outstanding ordinary shares. Accordingly, for so long as SoftBank and Yahoo remain substantial shareholders, we expect the Alibaba Partnership nominees will receive a majority of votes
cast at any meeting for the election of directors and will be elected as directors.  Our Challenges 
We believe some of the major risks and uncertainties that may materially and adversely affect us include the following: 
 


 

 
any failure to maintain the trusted status of our ecosystem could severely damage our reputation and brand;   


 

 
we may not be able to maintain or improve the network effects of our ecosystem;   


 

 
our operating philosophy may negatively influence our short-term financial performance;   


 

 
we may not be able to successfully monetize our mobile traffic;   


 

 
we may not be able to maintain our culture, which has been a key to our success;   


 

 
we may not be able to innovate or compete effectively;   


 

 
if the services Alipay provides to us are limited or restricted, our business would be harmed;


 
we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate, and increased investments in our business may negatively affect our margins;   


 

 
our revenue and net income may be materially and adversely affected by any economic slowdown in China as well as globally;   


 

 
there are risks and uncertainties associated with our variable interest entity structure; and   


 

 
the regulatory and legal system in China is complex and developing, and future regulations may impose additional requirements on our business.
We also face other challenges, risks and uncertainties that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects. You should consider the risks discussed in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this prospectus before investing in our ADSs.
Corporate History and Structure 
We have a demonstrated track record of successful organic business creation since our founding in 1999.
 


 

 
In 1999, we founded Alibaba.com and Alibaba.com.cn, the predecessor of 1688.com.   


 

 
In 2003, we launched Taobao Marketplace.   


 

 
In 2004, we established Alipay to address the issue of trust between buyers and sellers online. We have continued to offer payment and escrow services on our marketplaces through Alipay following divestment of our
interest in and control over Alipay in 2011. This divestment resulted from our managements response to regulations issued in June 2010 by the Peoples Bank of China, or the PBOC, that required non-bank payment companies to obtain a
payment business license before September 1, 2011. These regulations provided specific guidelines for license applications only for domestic PRC-owned entities but stated that specific guidelines applicable to license applications for foreign-invested payment entities would be issued separately (although no such guidelines have been issued as of the date of this prospectus). Accordingly, our management restructured the ownership and control of
Alipay into a company wholly-owned by PRC nationals in order to obtain a payment business license within the time period prescribed by the PBOC regulations. In August 2014, we entered into a share and asset purchase agreement, or the 2014 SAPA, with
Small and Micro Financial Services Company and the other parties to the 2011 restructuring, pursuant to which we further restructured the contractual arrangements between us and Small and Micro Financial Services Company.
 


 

 
In 2007, we launched Alimama, our online marketing technology platform.   


 

 
In 2008, we launched Tmall to address an increasing consumer need for branded products and a premium shopping experience.   


 

 
In 2009, we established Alibaba Cloud Computing to handle the increasing data management needs on our platform.   


 

 
In 2010, we launched the Mobile Taobao App.  Alibaba Group Holding Limited is a Cayman Islands
holding company established on June 28, 1999, and we conduct our business in China through our subsidiaries and variable interest entities.
Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among other areas, value-added telecommunications services, which
include Internet content providers, or ICPs, we, similar to all other entities with foreign-incorporated holding company structures operating in our industry in China, operate our Internet businesses and other businesses in which foreign investment
is restricted or prohibited in the PRC through

wholly-foreign owned enterprises, majority-owned entities and variable interest entities. The relevant variable interest entities, which are 100% owned by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned by
PRC citizens, hold the ICP licenses and operate the various websites for our Internet businesses. Specifically, our material variable interest entities are majority-owned by Jack Ma, our lead founder, executive chairman and one of our principal
shareholders, and minority-owned by Simon Xie, one of our founders and a vice president on our China investment team where he works on projects related to our China acquisition and investment activities. These contractual arrangements collectively
enable us to exercise effective control over, and realize substantially all of the economic risks and benefits arising from, the variable interest entities. See Our History and Corporate Structure  Contractual Arrangements among Our
Wholly-foreign Owned Enterprises, Variable Interest Entities and the Variable Interest Entity Equity Holders. The contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing operational control as direct ownership. See Risk Factors
 Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure.  As a result, we include the financial results of each of the variable interest
entities in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, as if they were our wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Other than the ICP licenses and other licenses and approvals for businesses in which foreign ownership is restricted or prohibited held by our
variable interest entities, we hold our material assets in, and conduct our material operations through, our wholly-foreign owned and majority foreign owned enterprises, which primarily provide technology and other services to our customers.
We conduct our business operations across approximately 290 subsidiaries and other consolidated entities. The chart below summarizes our
corporate legal structure and identifies our significant subsidiaries as that term is defined under Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, as well as our variable interest entities that are material to our business, and the
number of their respective subsidiaries, as of the date of this prospectus:

Each of these variable interest entities is 80%-owned by Jack Ma and 20%-owned by Simon Xie, other than Zhejiang Taobao Network Co., Ltd., which is 90%-owned by Jack Ma and 10%-owned by Simon Xie.
We generate the significant majority of our revenue directly through our wholly-foreign owned enterprises, which directly capture the profits
and associated cash flow from operations without having to rely on contractual arrangements to transfer such cash flow from the variable interest entities to the wholly-foreign owned enterprises. In fiscal year 2014, RMB6,170 million (US$995
million), or 11.8%, of our revenue was generated by our variable interest entities, and as of March 31, 2014, RMB18,874 million (US$3,042 million), or 16.9%, of our assets were held by our variable interest entities. These assets included
RMB13,159 million (US$2,121 million) in micro loans we made in connection with our SME loan business, which loans were principally funded by borrowings of RMB10,364 million (US$1,670 million). See Managements Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Contractual Obligations. We recently agreed to sell the SME loan business to Small and Micro Financial Services Company. The sale is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals
and other customary closing conditions. See Related Party Transactions  Agreements and Transactions Related to Small and Micro Financial Services Company and its Subsidiaries  2014 Restructuring of Our Relationship with Small and

(1)
In fiscal year 2014, these expenses included an equity-settled donation expense of RMB1,269 million (US$205 million) relating to the grant of options to purchase 50,000,000 of our ordinary shares to a non-profit
organization designated by Jack Ma and Joe Tsai.


(2)
We entered into the Technology and Intellectual Property Licensing Agreement with Yahoo, or the Yahoo TIPLA, in October 2005, pursuant to which we pay royalty fees to Yahoo. We and Yahoo amended the existing TIPLA in
September 2012, pursuant to which we made a lump sum payment in the amount of US$550 million.


(3)
Pro forma earnings per share attributable to ordinary shareholders is calculated as if our convertible preference shares had been converted into ordinary shares at the beginning of the period, or when the convertible
preference shares were issued, if later.


(4)
See  Non-GAAP Measures below.


(5)
For the three months ended June 30, 2014, includes a net gain of RMB6,251 million (US$1,008 million) from step-up acquisitions arising from revaluations of previously held equity interest. See note 4 to our unaudited
interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2014.  Non-GAAP Measures 
We use adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow, each a non-GAAP financial measure, in evaluating our operating results and for
financial and operational decision-making purposes.  We believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income help identify underlying
trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of the expenses that we include in income from operations and net income. We believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income provide useful information about our operating
results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.
We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash
generated by our business that can be used for strategic corporate transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making strategic investments and acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet. We use free cash flow to manage
our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance and allocate resources. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash
balance for a reporting period.  Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or
construed as an alternative to net income, cash flows or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow presented here may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data.
Adjusted EBITDA represents income from operations (which excludes interest and investment income (loss), net, interest expense, other income,
net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity investees) before (i) certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization, depreciation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets as well as
(ii) one-time expense items consisting of the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment and an equity-settled donation expense that we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the period presented.
Adjusted net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, amortization, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and
investments, gain (loss) on deemed disposals/disposals/revaluation of investments, and one-time expense items consisting of the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment, as well as an equity-settled donation expense.

Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our
consolidated cash flow statement less purchases of property and equipment (excluding acquisition of land use rights for, and construction of, our office campuses in China) and intangible assets, adjusted for changes in loan receivables relating to
micro loans of our SME loan business and the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment. We present the adjustment for changes in loan receivables because such receivables are reflected under cash flow from operating activities, whereas the secured borrowings
and other bank borrowings used to finance them are reflected under cash flows from financing activities, and accordingly, the adjustment is made to show cash flows from operating activities net of the effect of changes in loan receivables.
The table below sets forth a reconciliation of our income from operations to adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:
